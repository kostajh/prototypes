	text: '<p><b>Church order</b> is the systematically organized set of rules drawn up by a qualified body for the church.<sup>[1]</sup> From the point of view of civil law, the church order can be described as the internal law of the church.<sup>[1]</sup> A church order explains precisely what a document is, in a clinical and matter of fact tone, without conveying the spiritual nature of the document.<sup>[1]</sup></p><h3>Authority</h3><p>The authority of a church order is very closely linked to its relationship to Scriptures and the confessional texts of a church.<sup>[1]</sup> The fact that a church order provision is supported directly or indirectly by the Scriptures will to some degree, though not essentially, affect its authority.<sup>[1]</sup></p><h3>Evolution</h3><p>The British biblical scholar, B. H. Streeter identifies the Johannine epistles as the culmination of the New Testament understanding of church order with the author of Third Epistle of John confronting a serious matter as an official with recognized authority and experience who calls himself an \'Elder\' yet functions more like an Archbishop of later development.<sup>[2]</sup></p><h3>Denominations and alliances with church orders</h3><p>Many denominations have church orders that regulate the doctrines and practices of the church. Some church orders are also found in alliances or fellowships: Here are some sample church organizations that have church orders:<ul><li>Presbyterian Church in America<sup>3</sup></li><li>Christian Reformed Church in America<sup>4</sup></li><li>Reformed Church in America<sup>5</sup></li><li>Presbyterian (USA)<sup>6</sup></li><li>Christian Leaders Alliance<sup>7</sup></li><li>Church of the Brethren<sup>8</sup></li></ul></p>',

	text: '<p><b>Bahaettin Rahmi Bediz</b>  (1875–1951), also known as Bahaettin Rahmi Bediz and Rahmi Bediz, was a Cretan Turk who was the first Turkish photographer by profession. He started his career in Kandiye, Crete in 1895, and went on to open photography studios in İzmir in 1910, in İstanbul in 1915 where he acquired his fame, and in Ankara after 1935 where, aside from his private business, he worked as the Chief of Photography Department in Turkish Historical Society. He was known as Rahmi Bediz after the 1934 Surname Law in Turkey.</p><p>The thousands of photographs (especially portraits) he took during his career (Crete, İzmir, İstanbul, Ankara) have immense historical value.</p><p>In 1927/1928, while based in İstanbul and managing his own photographic studio (Photo Resné), he prepared for the Municipality of İzmir the booklet "Album de Smyrne", in French and in Turkish, a collection of İzmir photographs taken by him supplemented with explanatory texts. The album, distributed abroad through Turkey\'s embassies and consular offices, is notable both by being one of the first information and promotion packages prepared by the young Republic of Turkey for international readership, and also for having been one of the last books printed in Turkey in Arabic script, coming shortly before the transition to Latin alphabet.</p><p>He is still revered also in Crete for having been the first to capture the people and the landscapes of the island.<sup>[1]</sup></p><p>His son, Pertev Bediz (Peter Bediz for Canadians) also attained prominence by becoming one of the pioneers of the geophysical industry in Canada.<sup>[2]</sup></p><h3>Footnotes</h3><p><ol><li> "The Turkish-Cretan who captured history".

	title: 'Edward Edwards (Royal Navy officer)',
	description: 'Admiral Edward Edwards (1742–1815) was a British naval officer best known as the captain of HMS Pandora, the frigate which the Admiralty sent to the South Pacific in pursuit of the Bounty mutineers.',
	text: '<p>Admiral <b>Edward Edwards</b> (1742–1815) was a British naval officer best known as the captain of HMS Pandora,<sup>1</sup> the frigate which the Admiralty sent to the South Pacific in pursuit of the Bounty mutineers.</p><h3>Biography</h3><p><b>Early years</b></p><p>The fifth of six children, Edward Edwards was born in Water Newton, a village near Peterborough, to Richard Edwards of Water Newton and Mary Fuller of Caldicot. He was born in 1742 and christened in St Remegius\' Church, Water Newton. He never married.</p><p>On 7 September 1759, age 17, he was commissioned as a lieutenant. To qualify for this commission he would have been required, in addition to passing a lieutenant\'s exam, to produce evidence of at least six years of sea time. No documents have been located to date which would establish exactly when, and under whose patronage, he started his naval career. It is likely he first went to sea as a captain\'s servant when about 10 years old and subsequently completed at least part of the required sea time as a midshipman. A signature, \'Edwd Edwards\', inscribed on a document witnessing the Will of one Isaac Bishopbridge serving "on Board His Majestys Ship of Warr the Devonshire," suggests that Edwards may have sailed under Captain John Moore on HMS Devonshire in April 1756.</p><p>His naval career after he was commissioned included service in the following ships, before being appointed to Pandora:</p><ul><li>HMS Nassau, a 64-gun third rate, as fourth lieutenant</li><li>HMS Lowestoffe, a 32-gun fifth rate, as second lieutenant</li><li>HMS Pembroke, a 60-gun fourth rate, as third lieutenant, later promoted to first lieutenant</li><li>HMS Carcass, an 8-gun bomb vessel, 22 April 1778 – 5 December 1780, commanding officer</li><li>HMS Narcissus, a 20-gun sixth rate, (25 May 1781), paid off on 27 March 1784</li></ul><h3><i>Pandora</i> and the <i>Bounty</i></h3><p>He spent the following six years on half-pay after the end of the American Revolutionary war; until 6 August 1790, when he was appointed to take command of the frigate Pandora. He received new orders on 11 August to prepare his new command for a journey to "remote parts", on a mission in pursuit of the Bounty mutineers.</p><p>With the help of former Bounty midshipman Thomas Hayward - a Bligh loyalist recently returned to England from the South Pacific - Edwards succeeded in finding fourteen men (Bligh had stated that four of these were loyal but could not be accommodated on the over-full launch with the other loyal men; so Edwards found ten mutineers), but the Pandora foundered on the Great Barrier Reef on 29 August 1791 during the journey home from the South Pacific. Four of the ten mutineers and 31 of Pandora\'s crew died in the destruction of the ship. After an arduous open boat voyage from the wreck to Timor and on to Batavia (Jakarta), only 78 men of Pandora\'s original 134-strong crew eventually reached England, accompanied by six mutineers and four loyalists. For Hayward this was the second time in as many years that had he found himself in an open boat making for a safe haven in the Dutch East Indies.<sup>[2]</sup></p><p>Edwards was court-martialed on 17 September 1792 for the loss of the Pandora. Immediately prior to the proceedings, he submitted to the Admiralty his account of the events leading up to the sinking.<sup>[3]</sup> All of his officers supported Edwards\' contention that the frigate had been lost due to circumstances beyond anyone\'s control.</p><h3>Later life</h3><p>Edwards is said to have retired to Cornwall; according to a story linking him to the \'Pandora Inn\' along Restronguet Creek near Mylor, which he is alleged to have owned and renamed after retiring from the Navy. However, there is no documentary evidence to support this claim. Rather, together with a story about a figurehead adorning the Inn\'s stairwell, said to be based on an 18th-century original from the Pandora; this claim can be confidently refuted and relegated to the realm of creative copy-writing to advertise the inn, which according to cadastral records was called \'The Passage House\' until 1851, following the death of Alexander Luben, tenant and Restronguet Passage boatman from 1823 until his death in 1848.</p><h3>References</h3><ol></ol>',

	text: '<p>A <b>spark-ignition engine</b> (SI engine) is an internal combustion engine, generally a petrol engine, where the combustion process of the air-fuel mixture is ignited by a spark from a spark plug. This is in contrast to compression-ignition engines, typically diesel engines, where the heat generated from compression together with the injection of fuel is enough to initiate the combustion process, without needing any external spark.</p><h3>Fuels</h3><p>Spark-ignition engines are commonly referred to as "gasoline engines" in North America, and "petrol engines" in Britain and the rest of the world. However, these terms are not preferred, since spark-ignition engines can (and increasingly are) run on fuels other than petrol/gasoline, such as autogas (LPG), methanol, ethanol, bioethanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), hydrogen, and (in drag racing) nitromethane.<sup>[1]</sup></p><h3>Working cycle</h3><p>The working cycle of both spark-ignition and compression-ignition engines may be either two-stroke or four-stroke.</p><p>A four-stroke spark-ignition engine is an Otto cycle engine. It consists of following four strokes: suction or intake stroke, compression stroke, expansion or power stroke, exhaust stroke. Each stroke consists of 180 degree rotation of crankshaft rotation and hence a four-stroke cycle is completed through 720 degree of crank rotation. Thus for one complete cycle there is only one power stroke while the crankshaft turns by two or mor revolutions.</p><h3>References</h3><p><ol><li> Naijar, Yousef S.H. (2009).
